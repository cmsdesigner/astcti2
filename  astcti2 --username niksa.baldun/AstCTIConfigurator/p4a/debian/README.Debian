P4A for Debian
----------------

  The Debian package ships with a default configuration file for apache.
  It is located under the /etc/p4a/ directory and it is automatically
  symlinked into the /etc/APACHE-SERVER/conf.d directory. All configuration
  changes will also be removed when the package is purged. Make sure to adjust
  the configuration file provided to suit your needs.
