#summary Setup development environment with QTCreator

*Please follow these steps to get QTCreator up and running to develop AsteriskCTI.*

  # Download the right QTCreator LGPL version from [http://qt.nokia.com/downloads Nokia].
  # Run the setup. If - like me - you are on GNU/Linux, you need to make the downloaded .bin file executable. Do a `chmod u+x qt-sdk-linux-[your-version-here].bin` and then a `./qt-sdk-linux-[your-version-here].bin`
  # Once your QTCreator is installed, you need to build the MySQL Driver. Please check that you've mysql client libraries and development files installed before continue.
  # If you're on windows, you should:
    * Download MySQL Server from [http://www.mysql.com/downloads/ MySQL Website]. Note, i tested the win32 version and it seems to work fine.
    * Install MySQL to your C:\ drive in the C:\mysql path. Please include development files when install.
    * Open a dos prompt and `cd %QTDIR%\src\plugins\sqldrivers\mysql`
    * Edit the file mysql.pro and add these lines: `INCLUDEPATH+=c:\MYSQL\INCLUDE LIBS+=C:\MYSQL\LIB\OPT\libmysql.lib`
    * Execute `qmake` and then `mingw32-make`
    * Check that in `%QTDIR%\plugins\sqldrivers` you have the following files: `libqsqlmysql4.a, libqsqlmysqld4.a, libqsqlmysql4.dll, libqsqlmysqld4.dll`

  # If you're on GNU/Linux:
    * open a terminal and chdir into your qtsdk directory `qtsdk/src/plugins/sqldrivers/mysql`
    * Execute `qmake -o Makefile INCLUDEPATH+=/usr/include/mysql LIBS+=/usr/lib/libmysqlclient.a mysql.pro && make`
    * Copy the `libqsqlmysql.so` file in the `qtsdk/qt/plugins/sqldriver` directory.

That's all.
